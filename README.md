# SlashN

This is a game that I made for a final project. This will currently only work on my dedicated pseudo-arcade cabinet that I made. It takes input from 2 sets of joysticks and buttons and displays a fighting game that is entirely ASCII art. This game is started from the command line and uses this ASCII art styling to hold true to its command line origins. 

I intend to make this work with more devices and improve the game in the future.
